Latex Homework Template
-----------------------

A simple LaTeX homework template, originally based on the template from Josh Davis, [https://github.com/jdavis/latex-homework-template].
No cover page, just a header containing class/homework info, to save on paper. Math macros are modified, and demonstrated in the attached pdf.
